# From Bag of Sentences to Document: Distantly Supervised Relation Extraction via Machine Reading Comprehension
Source code for our paper [Source code for AAAI2020 paper:End-to-End Bootstrapping Neural Network for Entity Set Expansion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.04334)
## the dataset
The NYT dataset we used is from [THUNLP OpenNRE](https://github.com/thunlp/OpenNRE).
We propose it, you can download from [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1V6pWo5-EUPj4LJsTI_zsYzgTzC7Fhevj/view?usp=sharing).

Please first uncompress them and put it in the root dir, the path should be like "dataset/NYT/15/xxx"

## to train the model, please run
```bash
./train_nyt.sh
```
